Letâ€™s talk about [comma-dangle](http://eslint.org/docs/rules/comma-dangle). More specifically, letâ€™s talk about why you need to be using this eslint rule in your open source projects. Actually, scratch that. This is something thatâ€™s best learned through examples. Allow me to walk you through what happens when you donâ€™t use the comma-dangle rule.

## The Example

Okay, so letâ€™s pretend we have an awesome open source project we just created called beer.js. Letâ€™s go ahead and add some exports to our package

```diff
+ export default const beer = {
+   type: "IPA",
+   oz: "16"
+ };
```

See all the lines prefixed with a `+`? Those signify new additions to our repo. For our initial commit, weâ€™re gonna have `4` line additions and `0` deletions. Letâ€™s go ahead and add another value to our beer object

```diff
  export default const beer = {
    type: "IPA",
-   oz: "16"
+   oz: "16",
+   empty: false
  };
```

Now what happened here? We only added one value to our export, yet git is going to show `2` additions and `1` deletion. No doubt our commit message is going to be along the lines of `add empty prop to beer export`, and thereâ€™s absolutely nothing wrong with that! The problem is that the `oz` line is modified in that commit as well.

## With comma-dangle

Now letâ€™s look at the exact same git history, but this time letâ€™s enforce the `comma-dangle` rule.

```diff
+ export default const beer = {
+   type: "IPA",
+   oz: "16",
+ };
```

Again, our initial commit has a clean `4++++0----` history. Now letâ€™s go ahead and append another export onto this

```diff
  export default const beer = {
    type: "IPA",
    oz: "16",
+   empty: false,
  };
```

ðŸ’¥ BOOM! Now our commit history is going to be clean and concise. No more modifying lines just to add commas, let 'em dangle!

## Should I always use the comma-dangle?

Nope! Only when dealing with multiline objects/arrays. The easiest way to configure this, is to add the comma-dangle rule to your .eslintrc

```json
{
  "rules": {
    "comma-dangle": ["error", "always-multiline"]
  }
}
```

_(ironically, trailing commas are unsupported in JSON)_
